We are a robotics team for the RoboMaster University League (North America). 
Our goal is to build three combat ready robots to compete in a 3v3, League of Legends 
styled, tower defense. To do this we’ll need Engineers, Business leaders, and supporting 
staff. If these things sound interesting to you, then join our discord server! We’re 
just at the beginning of our journey and would love to have you with us!
