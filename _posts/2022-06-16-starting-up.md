**Transfer students from IVC**

Hello world! It's been a tough journey for us getting into UC Irvine. Each one of us has a personal story of trials and tribulations - but we made it. Armed with grit and determination, we step into RoboMaster University League (RMUL). Please follow our progress on this blog as we make our way! 

**First meeting**

The first meeting went well! Turnout was great and we've added several new members, mentors, and consultants. Up first, we'll be getting everyone acclimated to the RMUL competition and structure our organization.

**Systems Design**

The leads have been working on reading all of the rules documents from the RMUL 2022 competition. We will create an initial system design and basic 3D model of the Standard (Infantry) robot for the sake of finding sponsors.

That's all for now! See you soon.
